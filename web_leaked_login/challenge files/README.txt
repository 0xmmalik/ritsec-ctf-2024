We found [this service](https://flag-service.0xmmalik.repl.co/) that gives you a flag when you log in! We've managed to recover the login credentials of Zach, one of Anthony's former collaborators, and we think the flag service might give us a clue as to the whereabouts of his invention. The only trouble is, Zach has enabled multi-factor authentication on his account and we don't have access to his phone. See what you can do!
